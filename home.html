							<h2 class='blog-date'>March 1st, 2017</h2>
							<p class='blog-copy'>
								Since my graduation in October, I’ve wanted to write about my time
								at Thinkful. Honestly, it’s been hard to know where to start, and
								it was important to me that I dedicated enough time to adequately
								capture my experience. In short, Thinkful greatly exceeded my
								expectations in every respect and I have nothing but positive things
								to say about their program and their staff.
								<br />
								<br />
								Prior to Thinkful, I had no more than a few weeks of self-taught
								programming experience. For many years leading up to the program,
								I planned to learn to code at some point, if the opportunity presented
								itself. I had enjoyed my cursory exposure to programming and thought
								it might make for a cool hobby someday, but I never imagined I would
								be able to make a career out of it. Early last year, I came across
								several ads from various bootcamps and was immediately intrigued.
								The prospect of completely changing my career path in less than a
								year sounded amazing, but I definitely had reservations about the
								validity of their promises and claims. I researched the available
								programs extensively, but was not impressed by the first few I
								inquired about, which at best were unmemorable. In contrast, Thinkful
								had a unique quality from the start.
								<br />
								<br />
								On the initial, informational call, I instantly clicked with
								the program manager, whose academic backgrounds and interests
								paralleled my own. He was straightforward and thorough, and I
								appreciated that he provided me with a clear representation of not
								only what I could expect from the program, but also what it would
								require from me. Unlike my calls with some of the competitor bootcamps,
								our conversation in no way felt like a sales pitch. He was completely
								upfront about my possible options and the associated costs. It was
								apparent that his intentions were to help me decide whether the
								rigorous program would be the right fit for me, and to ensure that I
								fully understood the degree of commitment required for a successful
								outcome. I excitedly put in an application the same day. Within a
								couple weeks, I was notified of my acceptance, and the course started
								a few days later.
								<br />
								<br />
								One of my first noteworthy impressions of the program was the high
								quality of the other students in my cohort. I was in the second session,
								with seven others, ranging in age, academic backgrounds, and work histories.
								Initially, the only thing we all seemed to have in common was our programming
								background, or lack thereof. Nonetheless, we became acquainted straightaway,
								and I promptly had the realization that each one of us was hand-picked for
								our cohort. It was evident that careful thought went into building a balanced
								group of people who would mesh well and cultivate each other’s growth on a daily
								basis. It never felt like we were in competition with one another, or like there
								was a weak-link impeding the advancement of the rest of the class. We all were
								equally motivated to learn and willing to put in the required work and effort.
								I found myself helping one of my classmates understand a new concept just as
								often as they would teach me the finer points of something else. The high
								standard for acceptance into the program is what makes its peer-programming
								driven curriculum especially effective. Additionally, the supplemental reading
								materials are exceptional. The texts are extremely concise considering how
								content-rich they are. I never felt like I was buried in reading, but always
								had thorough explanations for reference when I needed them.
								<br />
								<br />
								Even still, the first several weeks were challenging, as the fast-paced course
								takes off at full speed from day one. There were moments where I doubted my ability
								to stay on track, but the 1-on-1 attention from the instructors/TAs/mentors made
								such a difference early on to prevent me from falling behind. One thing I love about
								Thinkful’s faculty is that they take such a personal interest in every student. It is
								not my nature to ask for assistance until a situation becomes dire, but I would regularly
								get the help I needed without asking for it. All of the instructors are expert programmers
								and could quickly zero-in on the holes in my comprehension from briefly scanning a few
								lines of my code. Accordingly, they would often provide answers to questions that I didn't
								even realize I had. Thinkful’s support team is also really wonderful. Whenever I had an
								administrative question or some other request, I would receive a swift response from the
								right person, who would be more than happy to help me. On a few occasions, I even received
								a compliment on one of my projects or some other positive feedback from a support team member,
								alongside their response to my request. To me, this perfectly illustrates how every person at
								Thinkful is involved in the progress of the students and dedicated to their success, regardless
								of whether or not they are directly involved in the learning process.
								<br />
								<br />
								Before I knew it, I was halfway through the course and was independently building full-stack
								web apps as side projects. This was a huge turning point for me, and I couldn't believe how
								much I had learned in two short months. Around this time, I experienced a newfound confidence
								in my coding ability. I witnessed not only my competency begin to increase rapidly, but also my
								love for programming. From that point on, I was literally coding around the clock. I would work
								all day on my projects for the course, and then would continue coding on my side projects in
								the evenings. Beyond the formidable skill-set I learned throughout the program, I also attribute
								the love I developed for programming to my instructors and mentors, who displayed their own
								genuine passion for coding on a daily basis.
								<br />
								<br />
								The second half of the course flew by even more quickly than the first. I remember feeling
								excitement on the last day, but it was coupled with an anxious uncertainty about what would
								happen next. While I was very confident in my programming ability by that point, I was concerned
								about no longer having the support system that I had relied on so heavily for the past four
								months. As a student, I felt this 'safety net' of people behind me. As I exited the program,
								I was unsure whether my growth and success would continue as an alumnus without that safeguard
								to fall back on. Luckily, I was never faced with that scenario -- the instructors and mentors
								I worked with throughout the course were just replaced by equally impressive career-prep coaches,
								but the unfailing support and guidance I received remained unchanged. At no point during the
								course or in the months that followed did I ever feel like I was on my own.
								<br />
								<br />
								I strongly dislike resumes/applications/interviews/marketing myself/etc., but Thinkful's
								career-prep personnel made these dreaded aspects of the job search as easy and painless as
								possible. They assisted me in every step of the process, helping me focus on small manageable
								tasks so that I never felt overwhelmed. Also, all of my former instructors and mentors continued
								to make themselves available to me. They were always happy to assist me with debugging or provide
								me with feedback, despite the fact that I was no longer a current student. Furthermore, several
								of them wrote recommendations for my applications and served as references throughout the interview
								process. At no point in my job search did I ever struggle to find help from someone when I needed it.
								<br />
								<br />
								Another aspect of my job search that I appreciated, was that I never felt pressure to apply to a
								job that didn’t fit what I was looking for, or accept an offer that I wasn’t thrilled about. In
								the same way, I always considered the advice I received from my career advisors to be in my best
								interest. I never felt like their guidance was influenced by some other agenda -- like getting me
								hired as quickly as possible and out of their hands. When I first learned about Thinkful’s guarantee
								(essentially that you will get hired within six months of graduation, in a full-time role as a
								programmer, or your money back), aside from the more obvious implications of this promise being a
								testament to the effectiveness of the course, it reassured me that I would be provided with adequate
								career support, reasoning was that they would be sufficiently motivated to protect my tuition funds
								in light of the guarantee. In reality, I had it backwards. They are able provide that guarantee
								because they are the best at what they do, and have built a highly skilled team that genuinely cares
								about their students. With that combination, there is no question that their students will be hired,
								as long as the appropriate commitment exists on the part of the student.
								<br />
								<br />
								In my past experiences with ‘guidance’ counselors or some equivalent, I can confidently say that this
								is not the norm. Before Thinkful, I was familiar with a dynamic in which my best interests were a much
								lower priority, and were eclipsed by many other considerations unrelated to my success. For example, my
								pre-med advisor in college was far more concerned about maintaining the school’s statistics surrounding
								acceptance and matriculation rates, to the extent that she would regularly discourage me from applying
								to med schools altogether, and instead direct my efforts toward a dentistry program or a career as a
								physician's assistant. She would prefer for me to aim small and guarantee her own success, than to
								reach toward something that was in line with my goals, but had a more uncertain outcome. As it turned
								out, I never did apply to medical school. Looking back, I feel like I should thank her -- I cannot
								imagine a situation in which I would receive the same gratification from a medical profession that
								I experience in my career as a programmer.
								<br />
								<br />
								A few weeks ago, I took on a full-time role as the sole software engineer for a small medical-device
								startup, where I'm building the corresponding mobile app. I am still blown away by the notion that I
								am being paid to write software full-time, not even nine months after that initial call with the
								program manager at Thinkful. Aside from the broad-base of programming knowledge I now posses, one of
								the most valuable skills Thinkful offers its students is how to think like a programmer. Additionally,
								they teach you how to learn, and how to do so extremely efficiently. Throughout my job search, whenever
								I saw a posting that mentioned experience with a technology I hadn’t used or some other requirement I
								didn’t quite meet -- I was never concerned that I might be unqualified for the job, because I was
								confident that I could quickly pick up any new skill. Instead, I was focused on how I could convey my
								learning capacity and adaptable nature to the hiring manager.
								<br />
								<br />
								Thinkful’s program is structured in a way that, as a student, you are positioned to absorb increasingly
								larger amounts of new information, over shorter periods of time. Effectively, I came out of the course
								with a very high potential for learning -- so much so, that my current employer was confident in hiring
								me to build their mobile app, despite my very limited prior experience with mobile app development. In
								a few short weeks, the app is well underway and I have another skill to add to my growing repertoire.
								Even now, Thinkful continues to serve as a valuable resource for me. I still refer back to the program’s
								curriculum frequently, and attend the Q&A sessions for supplemental code help a few times a week.
								Additionally, I continue to keep in touch with all of my former classmates and instructors, many of whom
								I chat with several times a week and consider to be close friends, despite having still never met them in
								person :) .
								<br />
								<br />
								Just to be clear, I do not work for Thinkful, and was not paid to write this review. I wanted to spread
								the word about what a genuinely good company they have, and what a solid programming bootcamp they offer.
								I feel like I owe them so much, as this experience has changed my life. This is my first salaried job and
								I'm earning more than I ever have previously. For the first time, I can honestly say that I'm fulfilled by
								the work I'm doing -- it is a very rewarding feeling to build a website or an app. Also, I love that I will
								always be challenged and continue to learn in this career. I don’t foresee ever feeling the mundane repetition
								in my current position that I've experienced in previous roles. In fact, my new job doesn't even feel like
								work at all -- I get to write code all day, my lunches are catered, I take ping-pong breaks whenever I need
								to move around for a bit, and my skateboard is my primary means of transportation inside the 'office'. In all
								seriousness, this is the first time that I have ever truly experienced firsthand the old adage, “Do what you
								love and you’ll never work a day in your life.” I wouldn't be able to say that without the opportunity Thinkful
								provided to me -- the opportunity to completely transform my career in a few short months.

								FULL-STACK WEB DEVELOPER, BIOLOGY GRADUATE, BLOCKCHAIN ENTHUSIAST
							</h1> -->
							<p>
								I grew up around tech -- my dad is an IT security
								consultant, so my academic interests always gravitated
								toward math and science. Accordingly, I was pre-med at
								Pepperdine University; however, despite my interest in
								medicine as a field of study, as graduation approached
								I found myself becoming increasingly disinterested in
								pursuing it as a career. Around this time my interest
								in tech peaked. I became fascinated with Bitcoin and
								Blockchain technology, and the first code I ever wrote
								was for cryptocurrency miners. While I could not yet
								appreciate these elegant lines of code, it was satisfying
								to engage in this world a little more fully. I began
								dreaming about a career as a programmer and concurrently
								regretting my college major. Since then, I have had
								several diverse work experiences. I quickly excelled
								in each of them, which illuminated a few key qualities
								in myself that facilitated these successes. Foremost,
								I am an extremely quick learner, with an aptness for
								teaching a newly acquired skill to others. I am an
								instinctive problem solver, and ancillary to my logical
								disposition is a refined creativity, which consistently
								distinguishes my work.
								</br>
								</br>
								I made a resolution this year to find my vocation,
								and within days I saw an ad for App Academy’s prep
								course. I viewed this as a singular opportunity to
								get my foot in the door of the tech industry and
								quickly applied. This course both imparted the
								fundamentals to me, and substantiated my notion that
								programming might be a great fit for me as a career.
								Subsequently, I enrolled in Thinkful’s full-stack web
								development program. The next four months flew by,
								and I cannot believe how much I’ve learned. At the
								start, I was just trying to soak up all of this new
								information, but then about halfway through everything
								clicked. My ‘break’ week, following week eight, was
								spent coding around the clock -- I built three
								full-stack apps before classes resumed. From that
								point on, I coded about twelve hours every day and
								always had a side project. I became increasingly
								fulfilled by my work and began experiencing firsthand
								the old adage, “Do what you love and you’ll never work
								a day in your life.”
								</br>
								</br>
								My greatest accomplishment was during week thirteen,
								when I independently built a backgammon game, against
								my mentor’s advice, who thought it would be out of
								scope for the five-day project. Not only was this
								inherently challenging, but I wrote the backend in
								Python, which I’d never used previously. I vividly
								remember feeling exceptionally focused and comfortable
								coding that week. Additionally, my capstone project,
								“Code Up”, was an extremely rewarding experience. I
								took the lead on the project since it originated from
								one of my proposals, serving as the project manager for
								a team of four. Relative to previous weeks, I coded far
								less, instead spending most days assisting a teammate
								with their code. This was a valuable opportunity to
								exercise my leadership and teaching skills in the context
								of programming. Also, I recognized that one of my strengths
								as a programmer is my ability to clearly visualize the big
								picture of an app from early on, and understand how it will
								all connect together, even if it’s unclear what the individual
								pieces will look like just yet. I’m incredibly proud of what
								we accomplished, as this was far more complex than anything
								we’d built previously, with extensive features and delicate
								socket handling.
								</br>
								</br>
								In sum, despite the relatively short timeline of my coding
								career, I believe that my academic background in the
								hard-sciences and my other life experiences have been
								preparing me for this career for some time -- laying out
								the groundwork on which I was able to quickly develop a
								formidable generalist programming ability. I absolutely
								love coding, and it has truly become the primary focus of
								my time and energy. I am ecstatic about starting a career
								as a software engineer and continuing to improve my programming
								skills.

											This project was started by one of my

											code and then I took over for a couple
											days to rewrite part of the backend and
											implement Socket.io. This was the first
											time I'd used Socket.io, and it was a
											great learning experience, giving me a
											much better understanding of how the
											server interacts with clients and how
											information can be selectively sent back
											to certain connections.
