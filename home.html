								Since my graduation in October, I’ve wanted to write about my time
								at Thinkful. Honestly, it’s been hard to know where to start, and
								it was important to me that I dedicated enough time to adequately
								capture my experience. In short, Thinkful greatly exceeded my
								expectations in every respect and I have nothing but positive things
								to say about their program and their staff.
								<br />
								<br />
								Prior to Thinkful, I had no more than a few weeks of self-taught
								programming experience. For many years leading up to the program,
								I planned to learn to code at some point, if the opportunity presented
								itself. I had enjoyed my cursory exposure to programming and thought
								it might make for a cool hobby someday, but I never imagined I would
								be able to make a career out of it. Early last year, I came across
								several ads from various bootcamps and was immediately intrigued.
								The prospect of completely changing my career path in less than a
								year sounded amazing, but I definitely had reservations about the
								validity of their promises and claims. I researched the available
								programs extensively, but was not impressed by the first few I
								inquired about, which at best were unmemorable. In contrast, Thinkful
								had a unique quality from the start.
								<br />
								<br />
								On the initial, informational call, I instantly clicked with
								the program manager, whose academic backgrounds and interests
								paralleled my own. He was straightforward and thorough, and I
								appreciated that he provided me with a clear representation of not
								only what I could expect from the program, but also what it would
								require from me. Unlike my calls with some of the competitor bootcamps,
								our conversation in no way felt like a sales pitch. He was completely
								upfront about my possible options and the associated costs. It was
								apparent that his intentions were to help me decide whether the
								rigorous program would be the right fit for me, and to ensure that I
								fully understood the degree of commitment required for a successful
								outcome. I excitedly put in an application the same day. Within a
								couple weeks, I was notified of my acceptance, and the course started
								a few days later.
								<br />
								<br />
								One of my first noteworthy impressions of the program was the high
								quality of the other students in my cohort. I was in the second session,
								with seven others, ranging in age, academic backgrounds, and work histories.
								Initially, the only thing we all seemed to have in common was our programming
								background, or lack thereof. Nonetheless, we became acquainted straightaway,
								and I promptly had the realization that each one of us was hand-picked for
								our cohort. It was evident that careful thought went into building a balanced
								group of people who would mesh well and cultivate each other’s growth on a daily
								basis. It never felt like we were in competition with one another, or like there
								was a weak-link impeding the advancement of the rest of the class. We all were
								equally motivated to learn and willing to put in the required work and effort.
								I found myself helping one of my classmates understand a new concept just as
								often as they would teach me the finer points of something else. The high
								standard for acceptance into the program is what makes its peer-programming
								driven curriculum especially effective. Additionally, the supplemental reading
								materials are exceptional. The texts are extremely concise considering how
								content-rich they are. I never felt like I was buried in reading, but always
								had thorough explanations for reference when I needed them.
								<br />
								<br />
								Even still, the first several weeks were challenging, as the fast-paced course
								takes off at full speed from day one. There were moments where I doubted my ability
								to stay on track, but the 1-on-1 attention from the instructors/TAs/mentors made
								such a difference early on to prevent me from falling behind. One thing I love about
								Thinkful’s faculty is that they take such a personal interest in every student. It is
								not my nature to ask for assistance until a situation becomes dire, but I would regularly
								get the help I needed without asking for it. All of the instructors are expert programmers
								and could quickly zero-in on the holes in my comprehension from briefly scanning a few
								lines of my code. Accordingly, they would often provide answers to questions that I didn't
								even realize I had. Thinkful’s support team is also really wonderful. Whenever I had an
								administrative question or some other request, I would receive a swift response from the
								right person, who would be more than happy to help me. On a few occasions, I even received
								a compliment on one of my projects or some other positive feedback from a support team member,
								alongside their response to my request. To me, this perfectly illustrates how every person at
								Thinkful is involved in the progress of the students and dedicated to their success, regardless
								of whether or not they are directly involved in the learning process.
								<br />
								<br />
								Before I knew it, I was halfway through the course and was independently building full-stack
								web apps as side projects. This was a huge turning point for me, and I couldn't believe how
								much I had learned in two short months. Around this time, I experienced a newfound confidence
								in my coding ability. I witnessed not only my competency begin to increase rapidly, but also my
								love for programming. From that point on, I was literally coding around the clock. I would work
								all day on my projects for the course, and then would continue coding on my side projects in
								the evenings. Beyond the formidable skill-set I learned throughout the program, I also attribute
								the love I developed for programming to my instructors and mentors, who displayed their own
								genuine passion for coding on a daily basis.
								<br />
								<br />
								The second half of the course flew by even more quickly than the first. I remember feeling
								excitement on the last day, but it was coupled with an anxious uncertainty about what would
								happen next. While I was very confident in my programming ability by that point, I was concerned
								about no longer having the support system that I had relied on so heavily for the past four
								months. As a student, I felt this 'safety net' of people behind me. As I exited the program,
								I was unsure whether my growth and success would continue as an alumnus without that safeguard
								to fall back on. Luckily, I was never faced with that scenario -- the instructors and mentors
								I worked with throughout the course were just replaced by equally impressive career-prep coaches,
								but the unfailing support and guidance I received remained unchanged. At no point during the
								course or in the months that followed did I ever feel like I was on my own.
								<br />
								<br />
								I strongly dislike resumes/applications/interviews/marketing myself/etc., but Thinkful's
								career-prep personnel made these dreaded aspects of the job search as easy and painless as
								possible. They assisted me in every step of the process, helping me focus on small manageable
								tasks so that I never felt overwhelmed. Also, all of my former instructors and mentors continued
								to make themselves available to me. They were always happy to assist me with debugging or provide
								me with feedback, despite the fact that I was no longer a current student. Furthermore, several
								of them wrote recommendations for my applications and served as references throughout the interview
								process. At no point in my job search did I ever struggle to find help from someone when I needed it.
								<br />
								<br />
								Another aspect of my job search that I appreciated, was that I never felt pressure to apply to a
								job that didn’t fit what I was looking for, or accept an offer that I wasn’t thrilled about. In
								the same way, I always considered the advice I received from my career advisors to be in my best
								interest. I never felt like their guidance was influenced by some other agenda -- like getting me
								hired as quickly as possible and out of their hands. When I first learned about Thinkful’s guarantee
								(essentially that you will get hired within six months of graduation, in a full-time role as a
								programmer, or your money back), aside from the more obvious implications of this promise being a
								testament to the effectiveness of the course, it reassured me that I would be provided with adequate
								career support, reasoning was that they would be sufficiently motivated to protect my tuition funds
								in light of the guarantee. In reality, I had it backwards. They are able to provide that guarantee
								because they are the best at what they do, and have built a highly skilled team that genuinely cares
								about their students. With that combination, there is no question that their students will be hired,
								as long as the appropriate commitment exists on the part of the student.
								<br />
								<br />
								In my past experiences with ‘guidance’ counselors
								or some equivalent, I can confidently say that this
								is not the norm. Before Thinkful, I was familiar
								with a dynamic in which my best interests were a much
								lower priority, and were eclipsed by many other
								considerations unrelated to my success. For example,
								my pre-med advisor in college was far more concerned
								about maintaining the school’s statistics surrounding
								acceptance and matriculation rates, to the extent that
								she would regularly discourage me from applying
								to med schools altogether, and instead direct my
								efforts toward a dentistry program or a career as a
								physician's assistant. She would prefer for me to aim
								small and guarantee her own success, than to
								reach toward something that was in line with my goals,
								but had a more uncertain outcome. As it turned
								out, I never did apply to medical school. Looking back,
								I feel like I should thank her -- I cannot imagine a
								situation in which I would receive the same gratification
								from a medical profession that I experience in my career
								as a programmer.
								<br />
								<br />
								A few weeks ago, I took on a full-time role as the
								sole software engineer for a small medical-device
								startup, where I'm building the corresponding mobile
								app. I am still blown away by the notion that I
								am being paid to write software full-time, not even
								nine months after that initial call with the
								program manager at Thinkful. Aside from the broad-base
								of programming knowledge I now posses, one of
								the most valuable skills Thinkful offers its students
								is how to think like a programmer. Additionally,
								they teach you how to learn, and how to do so extremely
								efficiently. Throughout my job search, whenever
								I saw a posting that mentioned experience with a
								technology I hadn’t used or some other requirement I
								didn’t quite meet -- I was never concerned that I
								might be unqualified for the job, because I was
								confident that I could quickly pick up any new skill.
								Instead, I was focused on how I could convey my learning
								capacity and adaptable nature to the hiring manager.
								<br />
								<br />
								Thinkful’s program is structured in a way that, as a
								student, you are positioned to absorb increasingly
								larger amounts of new information, over shorter periods
								of time. Effectively, I came out of the course
								with a very high potential for learning -- so much so,
								that my current employer was confident in hiring
								me to build their mobile app, despite my very limited
								prior experience with mobile app development. In
								a few short weeks, the app is well underway and I have
								another skill to add to my growing repertoire.
								Even now, Thinkful continues to serve as a valuable
								resource for me. I still refer back to the program’s
								curriculum frequently, and attend the Q&A sessions for
								supplemental code help a few times a week.
								Additionally, I continue to keep in touch with all of my
								former classmates and instructors, many of whom
								I chat with several times a week and consider to be close
								friends, despite having still never met them in person :) .
								<br />
								<br />
								Just to be clear, I do not work for Thinkful, and
								was not paid to write this review. I wanted to spread
								the word about what a genuinely good company they have,
								and what a solid programming bootcamp they offer.
								I feel like I owe them so much, as this experience has
								changed my life. This is my first salaried job and
								I'm earning more than I ever have previously. For the
								first time, I can honestly say that I'm fulfilled by
								the work I'm doing -- it is a very rewarding feeling to
								build a website or an app. Also, I love that I will
								always be challenged and continue to learn in this career.
								I don’t foresee ever feeling the mundane repetition
								in my current position that I've experienced in previous
								roles. In fact, my new job doesn't even feel like
								work at all -- I get to write code all day, my lunches
								are catered, I take ping-pong breaks whenever I need
								to move around for a bit, and my skateboard is my primary
								means of transportation inside the 'office'. In all
								seriousness, this is the first time that I have ever
								truly experienced firsthand the old adage, “Do what you
								love and you’ll never work a day in your life.” I
								wouldn't be able to say that without the opportunity
								Thinkful provided to me -- the opportunity to completely
								transform my career in a few short months.

								Prospective Student FAQs
							</h1>
							<h4 class='prospective-subtitle'>
								Are you considering enrolling in a Thinkful bootcamp? Here are
								<br/>
								my answers to a few of the questions I had as a prospective student:
							</h4>
							<h4 class='prospective-title-2'>
								How do I know if it’s the right fit for me?
							</h4>
							<p class='prospective-p'>
								Talk to a few programmers before you commit to
								the bootcamp. While the success stories of myself
								and others would likely be appealing to anyone in
								search of a vocation, it wouldn’t make sense for
								someone to go through the course if they
								fundamentally were not a good fit for this line
								of work. Although you can’t really know what
								programming is like until you learn how to code,
								make sure that the nature of the career itself
								appeals to you. Don’t worry about things like
								your typing being slow, your avoidance of
								keystroke shortcuts, or your aversion to
								learning new software platforms. You’re not
								expected to know anything coming into the
								course and your generalized computer competency
								will quickly advance throughout the program
								alongside your programming skills. Instead,
								ask yourself questions like, “Do I find new
								technology interesting?”, “Will I be happy with
								a primarily sedentary job?”, “Do I thrive in
								situations in which I’m mostly working
								independently?”, “Do I enjoy problem solving?”,
								“Am I comfortable learning more technical and
								abstract concepts?”, and most importantly, “I
								am excited to learn new and challenging skills?”.
							</p>

							<h4 class='prospective-title-2'>
								What is the real time commitment?
							</h4>
							<p class='prospective-p'>
								Make sure that you are willing and able to commit
								not only the required effort, but also the necessary
								time. An enthusiasm for coding and a will to work
								hard will only get you so far if you simply don’t
								have enough time to give to the program. Success
								in the bootcamp requires your full focus and
								dedication, and what you put into it is what
								you will get out of it. A few of my classmates
								completed the course successfully while working
								part-time, but I would really be hesitant to
								recommend the course to someone with responsibilities
								beyond that. Even then, you have to think of every
								hour allocated to something outside of the program
								as being one less hour of growth and preparation
								toward your career and desired goal.
								<br />
								<br />
								I was fortunate to have no other regular responsibilities
								throughout the program. I honestly spent somewhere on
								the order of 90% of my waking hours on the advancement
								of my programming skills. I’m not saying that you
								shouldn’t even bother if you can’t put in as much
								time as I did, but you will not have the outcome
								you’re looking for if you are only able to attend
								the daily sessions and meet the minimum requirements.
								If you answered yes to all of the questions in the first one
								but have concerns about the time commitment, try to reduce
								your other responsibilities in some way to better position
								yourself for success. In my case, I moved back in with my
								parents, asked for a forbearance period on my student loans,
								and took some other temporary measures in order to quit my
								job and give the program my full attention. If that sort
								of transition is out of the question for you at the moment,
								then shelf this idea for the time being and work toward
								creating a better situation for yourself, in which you
								could make the most of program at a later time. If you
								don’t forsee any point in the future in which your
								available time will open up, then consider Thinkful’s
								part-time bootcamp or other courses.
							</p>

							<h4 class='prospective-title-2'>
								Is the course worth its cost?
							</h4>
							<p class='prospective-p'>
								If you still feel like you’d be a good fit for the
								program after reading the first two, then what are
								you waiting for? :) Definitely don’t let the cost of
								the program deter you if it makes sense in all other
								respects. If I got a glimpse of my life today when I
								was a prospective student, I would not have hesitated
								to pay twice the tuition or more. The value of this
								opportunity is vastly greater than its price. And
								I can assure you that what you are quoted is what
								you will pay, and there are no hidden fees or
								additional costs. The tuition alone will get
								you the four-month course and everything that
								it entails, and your access to the curriculum,
								the network of people, and the other resources
								continue on past graduation. If you are simply
								concerned about your ability to pay for the tuition,
								then communicate your situation to someone at Thinkful.
								In the same way that they personalize the course for
								each student’s needs, they are willing to work with
								you to find a payment option that will fit your financial
								limitations. Last, Thinkful students are given discount
								to give to their friends and family, worth $500 off the
								price of a bootcamp. If you know someone who’s attended
								Thinkful, make sure to ask them for this. If not,

								Tips for Bootcamp Success
							</h1>
							<h4 class='prospective-subtitle'>
								Have you decided that a Thinkful bootcamp is the right fit for you,
								<br />
								or are you a current student at Thinkful?
								<br/>
								Here's what I learned in the program that will pose you for success:
							</h4>
							<h4 class='prospective-title-2'>
								Set up your development environment in advance of your first day.
							</h4>
							<p class='prospective-p'>
								You should have access to the curriculum before the course starts,
								you do nothing else in preparation, work through the first sections
								guiding you through the various registrations, installs, configs,
								etc. that you’ll need to get coding. Make sure you pay careful
								attention to the outcome of your installs, as it is easy to just
								type in a command and assume that when the script appears to have
								stopped that it completed successfully, when it ended in an error.
								Often, it will provide clear options or instructions for resolving
								too, and it is a lot easier to address when you’re on the topic and
								not a couple weeks down the road when something seemingly unrelated
								won’t work as the result of a requirement never being installed
								properly. Make sure everything, including your operating system
								itself, has been updated.
								<br />
								<br />
								Also, clear your desktop, downloads bookmarks, etc. of clutter and create
								an organized file structure for your coursework, as your projects and other
								resources will quickly pile up. Make sure that you keep track of your
								credentials, as you will be signing up for dozens of technologies and
								services over the next few months.
								<br />
								<br />
								Last, make sure you use the same email address that you registered with
								on GitHub to configure your Git command-line tools. I don’t remember the
								importance of this being stressed initially, and while it may be an edge-case
								scenario, I learned this the hard way. Apparently, in my anxious attempts to
								keep up with the other students on the first day of class, I made
								a typo when I entered my email in the Git config, which will accept
								whatever you input. This resulted in all of my code contributions
								from the next several months to be attributed to an email account
								that I did not own. Luckily, when I finally noticed this toward
								the end of the course, the email address was still available, so
								I was able to register for it and add it to my GitHub account.
								This was following a small freakout about the possibility of all
								the work I had done throughout the course not being reflected in
								my contribution statistics, as around this time I was also learning
								about how potential employers pay close attention to this. Moral
								of the story, take care in setting everything up properly, even
								though you will have no idea what is especially important at that
								point.

								FULL-STACK WEB DEVELOPER, BIOLOGY GRADUATE, BLOCKCHAIN ENTHUSIAST
							</h1> -->
							<p>
								I grew up around tech -- my dad is an IT security
								consultant, so my academic interests always gravitated
								toward math and science. Accordingly, I was pre-med at
								Pepperdine University; however, despite my interest in
								medicine as a field of study, as graduation approached
								I found myself becoming increasingly disinterested in
								pursuing it as a career. Around this time my interest
								in tech peaked. I became fascinated with Bitcoin and
								Blockchain technology, and the first code I ever wrote
								was for cryptocurrency miners. While I could not yet
								appreciate these elegant lines of code, it was satisfying
								to engage in this world a little more fully. I began
								dreaming about a career as a programmer and concurrently
								regretting my college major. Since then, I have had
								several diverse work experiences. I quickly excelled
								in each of them, which illuminated a few key qualities
								in myself that facilitated these successes. Foremost,
								I am an extremely quick learner, with an aptness for
								teaching a newly acquired skill to others. I am an
								instinctive problem solver, and ancillary to my logical
								disposition is a refined creativity, which consistently
								distinguishes my work.
								</br>
								</br>
								I made a resolution this year to find my vocation,
								and within days I saw an ad for App Academy’s prep
								course. I viewed this as a singular opportunity to
								get my foot in the door of the tech industry and
								quickly applied. This course both imparted the
								fundamentals to me, and substantiated my notion that
								programming might be a great fit for me as a career.
								Subsequently, I enrolled in Thinkful’s full-stack web
								development program. The next four months flew by,
								and I cannot believe how much I’ve learned. At the
								start, I was just trying to soak up all of this new
								information, but then about halfway through everything
								clicked. My ‘break’ week, following week eight, was
								spent coding around the clock -- I built three
								full-stack apps before classes resumed. From that
								point on, I coded about twelve hours every day and
								always had a side project. I became increasingly
								fulfilled by my work and began experiencing firsthand
								the old adage, “Do what you love and you’ll never work
								a day in your life.”
								</br>
								</br>
								My greatest accomplishment was during week thirteen,
								when I independently built a backgammon game, against
								my mentor’s advice, who thought it would be out of
								scope for the five-day project. Not only was this
								inherently challenging, but I wrote the backend in
								Python, which I’d never used previously. I vividly
								remember feeling exceptionally focused and comfortable
								coding that week. Additionally, my capstone project,
								“Code Up”, was an extremely rewarding experience. I
								took the lead on the project since it originated from
								one of my proposals, serving as the project manager for
								a team of four. Relative to previous weeks, I coded far
								less, instead spending most days assisting a teammate
								with their code. This was a valuable opportunity to
								exercise my leadership and teaching skills in the context
								of programming. Also, I recognized that one of my strengths
								as a programmer is my ability to clearly visualize the big
								picture of an app from early on, and understand how it will
								all connect together, even if it’s unclear what the individual
								pieces will look like just yet. I’m incredibly proud of what
								we accomplished, as this was far more complex than anything
								we’d built previously, with extensive features and delicate
								socket handling.
								</br>
								</br>
								In sum, despite the relatively short timeline of my coding
								career, I believe that my academic background in the
								hard-sciences and my other life experiences have been
								preparing me for this career for some time -- laying out
								the groundwork on which I was able to quickly develop a
								formidable generalist programming ability. I absolutely
								love coding, and it has truly become the primary focus of
								my time and energy. I am ecstatic about starting a career
								as a software engineer and continuing to improve my programming
								skills.
